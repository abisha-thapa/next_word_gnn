# __Next Word Suggestion using Graph Neural Network__

## __Description__
This is a research project for _Data Mining_ course.

__Abstract__

Language Modeling is a prevalent task in Natural Language Processing. The currently existing most recent and most successful language models often tend to build a massive model with billions of parameters, feed in a tremendous amount of text data, and train with enormous computation resources which require millions of dollars. In this project, we aim to address an important sub-task in language modeling, i.e., context embedding. We propose an approach to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context of preceding words. We test this on the custom Wikipedia text corpus using a very limited amount of resources and show that this approach works fairly well to predict the next word.
